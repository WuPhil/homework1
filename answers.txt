Q1: What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A: Both of these actions are ways to manage code history when there are 2 separate branches of one code, one being a "main" branch, and a separate branch known as a "feature branch."
A merge is where the both of the branches directly combine in a single step. It can be thought of as having 2 separate parents that "combine history" to make the newest version of the code. In blogs and stack overflow diagrams, this is seen as a diamond since it sees 1 origin for 2 branches that converge back together.
A rebase is when one of the 2 branches decides to become the base and makes its commit (one becomes the base, and afterwards the other branch is added), so the history for the code has a new base. The blogs and stack overflow digrams show this as a straight line, with the main branch commiting itself first and the second being added later, as the history is "flattened."

Q2: What is a remote repository?

Remote repositories refer to any repositories that aren't hosted on your local machine (those would be local repositories). They are helpful since it allows for easier ways to share code / projects with others, and can allow collaboration and synchronizing changes easily.

(i tried for about 20 minutes to get a merge conflict to get both answers using only Git, but it does not believe there is one. Maybe fast forwarding or some resolution system is too good but I couldn't get it.)
